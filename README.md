# Unriddle Take Home Test 2 Version 1

This is a Metadata Retrieval tool, where users can insert URL of PDFs and Research Paper and they can get the author and title of those files. 

This app extracts the data based on the ISBN, DOI or arXiv ID.

This app uses NextJS Page Router with TypeScript to parse the URLs using PDF-Parse.



## Version 2

- I am working on building a web crawler using Puppeteer or Cheerio.

- This bot will get the required data and store it in the JSON format.

- I am currently working on it and I am halfway done to implement this app.
## Deployment

To deploy this project run:

```bash
  npm run install
  npm run dev
```
